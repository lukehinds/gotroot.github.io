So after accepting and starting my new role at Red Hat, I traveled to Munich for New Hire Orientation (NHO)

NHO is something that everyone joining Red Hat, undergoes to help them adopt and learn about Red Hats working culture and history.

Sessions were around HR, Office Real Estate and IT support, with Jan Wildeboer doing his spot on evangelism.   

We also had a tour of the city, followed by Bavarian food (and Beer of course)
