I am software engineer who works @ [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) with an
interest and focus on security.

I am also a Dad / Husband (more important job!) and like to spend my
spare time hiking and trial running.

I am currentlty hoping to the the Spine Race as my next event.

Views are my own and not that my employer, past present or future.
