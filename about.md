I am software engineer who works @ [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) with an
interest and focus on security.

I am also a Dad / Husband (more important job!) and like to spend my
spare time hiking and trial running. I am currently traning to take part
in the [Fan Dance](http://www.thefandancerace.com/), a 24km load bearing
exercise over Pen y Fan, the highest mountain in the Brecon Beacons,
Wales.

You can find me on twitter @ [lukeahinds](https://twitter.com/lukeahinds).

These pages tend to be my notes exported to markdown and then checked into my
gitpages repo.

Views are my own and not that my employer, past present or future.
