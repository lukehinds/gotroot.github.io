I am software engineer who works @ [Red Hat](http://redhat.com) and you can find
me on twitter @ [lukeahinds](https://twitter.com/lukeahinds).

These pages tend to be my notes exported to markdown and then checked into my
gitpages repo.

Views are my own and not that my employer, past present or future.
